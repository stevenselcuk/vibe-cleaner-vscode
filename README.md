# Code Cleaner (Comment & Console Remover)


Tired of comments and `console.log` statements cluttering your codebase? **Code Cleaner** is a simple yet powerful Visual Studio Code extension designed to help you instantly clean up this noise from your JavaScript, JSX, and TSX files.

It's the perfect tool for making your production code cleaner and more readable with a single command.

## ✨ Features

*   **Smart Comment Removal:** Removes all single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments. It's smart enough to ignore comment-like patterns inside string literals or URLs.
*   **Dedicated `console.log` Removal:** Strips out all `console.log()` statements with a separate, dedicated command.
*   **Broad Language Support:** Fully compatible with JavaScript (`.js`), JSX (`.jsx`), TypeScript (`.ts`), and TSX (`.tsx`) files.
*   **Easy to Use:** Works with two simple commands right out of the box—no configuration required.
